## Soup Iterator
The Beautiful Soup Iterator iterates on the given html/xml file and outputs tags in document order. The iterator both provides a new way to process tags as well as the ability to handle more complex processing.

Before, we would have to create a new list to store every tag from Beautiful Soup. Instead of loading the tags into a brand new list, the iterator allows for more efficient processing on individual tags without requiring additional memory.

I believe that implementing the Beautiful Soup Iterator would provide a more robust and Pythonic way to process html/xml files.
